# Flights Data Exploration
## by (Aya Abulnasr)


## Flights Exploration Dataset

> This dataset reports the flights in the United States, including carriers, arrival and departure delays, and reasons for delays in 2008 through all year months. I will do some data exploration over our csv data file using some visualization and numbers.
I analyzed mainly the reason of delay and flight cancellations using univariate exploration, bivariate and mulitvariate exploration.
I tried to make the visuals as much simple as possible.

## Summary of Findings

> On Genral, Flights delay has a strong relationship with aircraft arrival delay tothe airport also with carriers delay reasons such as aircraft cleaning, aircraft damage, crew, baggage, bird strike, fueling and so on. also the other delay reason could happens due to NASDelay "National Airspace System" as the airport operations & heavy traffic volume.

>Cancellatons happen mainly due to weather circumstances factor as it has the most effect on big carriers' flights such as MQ "American Eagle Airlines" also NAS has a big effect when the delay is more than 60 minutes! the flight got cancelled.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Canceled Flights exploration and reasons why it's cancelled. Also, the reasons od Delay with carriers.
